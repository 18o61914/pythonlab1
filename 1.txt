Slaves, Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word
Live in fear
Faith of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait, something must be done
Four hundred years

[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
[Verse 2]
Now, let my people go
Land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee
Bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong
Down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long
Hail to fire

[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Die by my hand
(Die) I creep across the land
(Die) Killing first born man
Die by my hand
(Die) I creep across the land
(Die) Killing first born man
[Verse 3]
I rule the midnight air
The destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there
Deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor
Final darkness
Blood, lamb's blood painted door
I shall pass

[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

End of passion play
Crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear
Sucking darkeness clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your
Master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Needlework the way
Never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly
Ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your Master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
(Master, master)
Master
Master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master
Master
Promised only lies
Laughter
Laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter
Laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that
Natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze
Drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master
Master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery

[Verse 2]
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery

[Verse 3]
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery
Battery, battery
